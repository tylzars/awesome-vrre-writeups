# Awesome VR/RE Writeups

> A collection of Vulnerability Research and Reverse Engineering writeups.

With such a pleathora of knowledge for VR/RE out in the world these days it's impossible to keep track of every vulnerability type. This page is a list of articles from around the internet that break down in-depth the exploit and the exploitation steps. If it don't have source/dissassembly/PoC, is it really a writeup?

This repository contains a list of hardware/software VR/RE articles that can break down into most of anything you may be looking for. This will get a table of contents where the types are broken down in the future, I just wanted to move my notes onto GitHub for the time being.

Please feel free to make a PR to add writeups you may have. All credit for anything posted here goes to the original posters.
